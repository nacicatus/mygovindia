The Govt. of India has set up the myGovIndia website for ordinary citizens to register their suggestions and participate in the Good Governance Initiative.
This app basically recreates the mygovindia website inside a UIWebView on the screen and allows you to tweet a suggestion to the Prime Minster's Office.
